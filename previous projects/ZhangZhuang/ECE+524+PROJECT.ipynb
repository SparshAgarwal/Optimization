    "   Our project is focusing on conducting an optimized route for capacited transpotation problem. In particular, we are aiming to optimize under various conditions including optimized routing, optimized driving schedule with limited driving time, optimized time schedule, and optimized loading schedule.\n",
    "   First, a little bit about project's history, background and why it is very important. Companies always try to deliver their goods to their customers in the most effecient way to cut down the cost and fulfil the customers' demand on time. Finding a scheme to transport goods in the most efficient way is a classical problem known as \"Vehicle Routing Problem\" (VRP). VRP is an extension of \"Traveling Salesman Problem\"(TSP) and has many variants. In this project, we particularly focus on a VRP variant called \"Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem\" (CVRP). CVRP specifically examines the situation where multiple vehicles are used to deliver one type of commodity and each vehicle has uniform capacity and are considered identical ([citations](https://www.ripublication.com/gjpam16/gjpamv12n1_64.pdf)).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The background of our project is running a forest harvest company. Our Forest Harvest Company has 12 logging sites that are separated in 12 different areas and each logging site plants and produces one type of tree. Everyday, we will send out 3 vehicles from our only warehouse located at logging site 1 to pick up the trees cut at other logging sites. Each vehicle has uniform capacity and drives at the same speed. In other words, the vehicles  are considered identical. These vehicles pick up the loads at each logging site in such way that (1) each site will only be visited once by one truck and the truck will pick up all its trees at once, (2) all logging sites must be visited, (3) all trucks must go back to the warehouse at the end of the day, and (4) the total number of demand of all logging sites visited by a truck does not exceed its capacity. Our project analysizes four scenarios where we aim to find the basic optimal routes, the optimal routes with distance limit, the optimal routes with shortest finish time, and the optimal routes with different priorities assigned to logging sites, respectively.\n",

    "## 2. Mathematical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Details\n",
    "\n",
    "There are total of four scenarios in the project. Each scenario is interconnected with more and more constraints added. In scenario 1, we will find a closed route for each truck so that (1) each site will only be visited once by one truck and the truck will pick up all its trees at once, (2) all logging sites must be visited, (3) all trucks must go back to the warehouse at the end of the day, and (4) the total number of requests that can be served in one route by a truck does not exceed the capacity of the truck. Our objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by all of the trucks while fulfiling all the requirements mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenario 2, an additional distance limit constraint will be added to make sure that no driver will drive more than a specified distance everyday for safety. The distance limit is denoted as P in the following implementation. We will see in this section that how adding this extra constraint will affect the routes in which the trucks travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenario 3, the forest harvest company can only start shipping everyday harvest altogether to the customers until the last truck come back to the warehouse. Since we have the assumption that all trucks are identical and travel at the same speed, the length of the longest route taken by the truck determines the shipping time. In order to deliver orders to the customers as soon as possible, we aim to get the optimal traveling scheme which can minimize the finish time of all of the trucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenario 4, different priorities, indicated by S values, will be assigned to logging sites so that the logging sites with big S values should be visited prior to the logging sites with small values. This scenario is worth being discussed because vehicles used to transport trees may have open trunks, the drivers have to pick up big trees before small trees to assure the stability of their loads. In this section, we will show you how adding this additional constraint will affect the routes taken by the vehicles.\n"

    "Overall, we managed to solve for the optimized solution and route under some real-life conditions. The model we used is capacited vehicle routing problem, which allows us to have vehicles that have uniform capacty and only visit each site once. For each part of the problems in this project, we add more and more constriants and refinations so that we have a tradeoff between the real-life conditions and performance. The more real we model our problem, the more constraints that we have to add. As we discovered, the more constriants we add to minimize the time used in our routing problem, the more equalized diatance we get for each truck. It is a solution very interesting to notice. Unfortunatly, if we extand our interest in making the problem more real, we will encounter some nonlinear constraints and cost functions that are very tough to deal with. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many questions that we can consider in the future. For example, how to add the time variable since trees have different rate of growth and the transportation time, speeds and distance can also vary? How to add cost into the scenerio like gas fee, variable labor cost etc. In addition, we can test our model with larger and extanded amount of data."
