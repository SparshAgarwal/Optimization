    "    Our project idea is focussing on optimizing how a 2018 Honda Accord would drive around a track. Specifically, given a fixed amount of fuel, fixed turn radius, and fixed tire specifications; What is te optimal distance that the car could travel around a curve. This will give us the optimal trajectory for the car to take around a turn to maximize the fuel efficiency. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    We applied several mathematical functions that coorelated real world Physical constraints to the model. These were gravity, friction, and Centripital force. We ignored air resistance because of the magnitude of difficulty that would applyn to the model. We \n",

    "2. Track Assembly\n",
    "    Our first task was to generate a two dimmensional array that would act as the race track. This involved a 2-d array filled with zeros. Then ones would be inserted into the array to be the track, with a starting line and finish line being 2's and 3's. We found the best way to do this was to use java code with a bitmap and write a script to convert the bitmap into a csv file. \n",
