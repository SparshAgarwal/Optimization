As far as data goes, we will start with 5 companies and add features(fake data) incrementally, based in our discussed options. Once the model starts to build up, we might switch to real data if we have time. For model we will be following the below steps: Step 1: Find the relationship between the companies valuations/profits based on various factors(which will be implemented incrementally). Features planned to use: Sectors of business (Industry relevance to weight sectors) Sugar Electronics Lumber Students supplies Automobile Country based in (economic stability, Stability of policies/regulations in the sectors) US China Russia India UK Germany Previous stock relationship Beta value relation to market Dividend relation Stock price variation Purchase pattern variation Market share Same commodity Competitive commodities Public opinion / demand(integrity/scandalous) Work-Life balance\n",

    "        Our project idea focused on optimizing how a Formula one car would drive around a track. Specifically, given a fixed amount of time, and a track parameter; what is the optimal path that the car could would take around a curve. This gives us information on the minimum amount of time required for a racecar to navigate a track.\n",
    "\tThis problem is based in formula one racing.  Formula one is the highest class of auto racing and has an estimated 2.9-billion-dollar investment in auto technology by the teams each year. (Wikipedia) Thus optimizing track routes can help improve driver efficiency, as well as car engineering, and improve the performance of both cars and racers.  This is one of the primary problems related to racing, as corners are the main location where speed is lost. While Formula One cars use a series of \n",
    "\tOur problem focuses on minimizing the time required for a Formula One car to drive around a curve, and reach an endpoint farther along the track. Our problem space included limits on turning ability, speed of the car, acceleration of the car, and friction applied to the car as it drives. These constraints ensure the car is forced to account in speed as it rounds a curve, and is not able to make impossibly sharp curves. We created several different variations of curves for the car to navigate. \n",
    "    \tWe applied several mathematical functions that correlated real world Physical constraints to the model. These were gravity, friction, and Centripetal force. We ignored air resistance because of the magnitude of difficulty that would apply to the model. (Are we going to be able to limit its direction?) We gathered the general information from sources on the internet, then developed the equations and constraints to apply to the model. \n",

    "    Our first task was to generate a two dimmensional array that would act as the race track. This involved a 2-d array filled with zeros. Then ones would be inserted into the array to be the track, with a starting line and finish line being 2's and 3's. We found the best way to do this was to use java code with a bitmap and write a script to convert the bitmap into a csv file. \n",
